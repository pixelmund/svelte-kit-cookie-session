# Svelte Kit Cookie Session [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/pixelmund/svelte-kit-cookie-session.svg)](https://github.com/pixelmund/svelte-kit-cookie-session) [![Latest Stable Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/svelte-kit-cookie-session.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-kit-cookie-session)

⚒️ Encrypted "stateless" cookie sessions for SvelteKit

---

Check out, [Svemix](https://github.com/svemix/svemix) if you want to have a better developer experience using **SvelteKit**. Svemix can be seen as an full stack addition to **Kit**. It let's you write server side code inside .svelte files, has session handling on the next level with auto client session updates, loaders and actions that run on the server and even working with javascript disabled, also provides you with meta/SEO handling.

---

**This [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) backend utility** allows you to create a session to be stored in the browser cookies via a encrypted seal. This provides strong client/"stateless" sessions.

The seal stored on the client contains the session data, not your server, making it a "stateless" session from the server point of view. This is a different take than `express-session` where the cookie contains a session ID to then be used to map data on the server-side.

---

**By default the cookie has an ⏰ expiration time of 7 days**, set via [`expires`] which should be a `number` in `days`.

---

## Upgrading from v1 to v2

Please use any version above `@sveltejs/kit@1.0.0-next.232`, all older versions are not compatible with v2 anymore. Stick to `1.4.0` if you like to use older versions of `kit`.
There are no major breaking changes, besides some internal refactoring and switching from JS Proxy to Getters/Setters which should end up in a better performance. We also only decrypt the session data now if you access the session.data. Also the session data returns undefined now if not existing instead of an empty object.

## Installation

Install into `dependencies`

```bash
npm i svelte-kit-cookie-session

yarn add svelte-kit-cookie-session
```

> :warning: **Because of some vite issues [#14](https://github.com/pixelmund/svelte-kit-cookie-session/issues/14) [#15](https://github.com/pixelmund/svelte-kit-cookie-session/issues/15)**: you should add the following to your `svelte.config`!

```js
const config = {
  kit: {
    vite: {
      optimizeDeps: {
        exclude: ["svelte-kit-cookie-session"],
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Update your `app.d.ts` file to look something like:

```ts
/// <reference types="@sveltejs/kit" />

interface SessionData {
  // Your session data
  views: number;
}

// See https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#typescript
// for information about these interfaces
declare namespace App {
  interface Locals {
    session: import("svelte-kit-cookie-session").Session<SessionData>;
    cookies: Record<string, string>; // all parsed cookies are automatically set from handleSession to avoid overhead
  }

  interface Platform {}

  interface Session extends SessionData {}

  interface Stuff {}
}
```

## Usage

You can find an example implementation here [Example](/example).

The secret is a private key or list of private keys you must pass at runtime, it should be at least `32 characters` long. Use [Password Generator](https://1password.com/password-generator/) to generate strong secrets.

⚠️ You should always store secrets in secret environment variables on your platform.

### Initializing

> src/hooks.ts || src/hooks/index.ts

```js
import { handleSession } from "svelte-kit-cookie-session";

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').GetSession} */
export async function getSession({ locals }) {
  return locals.session.data;
}

// You can do it like this, without passing a own handle function
export const handle = handleSession({
  secret: "SOME_COMPLEX_SECRET_AT_LEAST_32_CHARS",
});

// Or pass your handle function as second argument to handleSession

export const handle = handleSession(
  {
    secret: "SOME_COMPLEX_SECRET_AT_LEAST_32_CHARS",
  },
  ({ event, resolve }) => {
    // event.locals is populated with the session `event.locals.session`
    // event.locals is also populated with all parsed cookies by handleSession, it would cause overhead to parse them again - `event.locals.cookies`.

    // Do anything you want here
    return resolve(event);
  }
);
```
In case you're using [sequence()](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#sveltejs-kit-hooks-sequence), do this 
```js

const sessionHandler = handleSession(
  {
    secret: "SOME_COMPLEX_SECRET_AT_LEAST_32_CHARS",
  },
  ({ event, resolve }) => {
    // event.locals is populated with the session `event.locals.session`
    // event.locals is also populated with all parsed cookies by handleSession, it would cause overhead to parse them again - `event.locals.cookies`.

    // Do anything you want here
    return resolve(event);
  }
);

export const handle = sequence(sessionHandler, first, second)
```


### ♻️ Secret rotation is supported. It allows you to change the secret used to sign and encrypt sessions while still being able to decrypt sessions that were created with a previous secret.

This is useful if you want to:

- rotate secrets for better security every two (or more, or less) weeks
- change the secret you previously used because it leaked somewhere (😱)

Then you can use multiple secrets:

**Week 1**:

```js
export const handle = handleSession({
  secret: "SOME_COMPLEX_SECRET_AT_LEAST_32_CHARS",
});
```

**Week 2**:

```js
export const handle = handleSession({
  secret: [
    {
      id: 2,
      secret: "SOME_OTHER_COMPLEX_SECRET_AT_LEAST_32_CHARS",
    },
    {
      id: 1,
      secret: "SOME_COMPLEX_SECRET_AT_LEAST_32_CHARS",
    },
  ],
});
```

Notes:

- `id` is required so that we do not have to try every secret in the list when decrypting (the `id` is part of the cookies value).
- The secret used to encrypt session data is always the first one in the array, so when rotating to put a new secret, it must be first in the array list
- Even if you do not provide an array at first, you can always move to array based secret afterwards, knowing that your first password (`string`) was given `{id:1}` automatically.

### Setting The Session

`If the session already exists, the data get's updated but the expiration time stays the same`

`The only way to set the session is setting the locals.session.data to an object`

> src/routes/login.ts

```js
/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').RequestHandler} */
export async function post({ locals, request }) {
  locals.session.data = { loggedIn: true };

  return {
    body: locals.session.data,
  };
}
```

### Accessing The Session

`After initializing the session, your locals will be filled with a session JS Proxy, this Proxy automatically sets the cookie if you set the locals.session.data to something and receive the current data via locals.session.data only. To see this in action add a console.log(locals.session) it will be empty. Only if you add an console.log(locals.session.data) and access the data it will output the current data. So if you wonder why is my session not filled, this is why`

> src/routes/api/me.ts

```js
/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').RequestHandler} */
export async function get({ locals, request }) {
  // console.log(locals.session) will be empty

  // Access your data via locals.session.data -> this should always be an object.
  const currentUser = locals.session.data?.user;

  return {
    body: {
      me: currentUser,
    },
  };
}
```

### Destroying the Session

> src/routes/logout.ts

```js
/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').RequestHandler} */
export async function del({ locals }) {
  locals.session.destroy();

  return {
    body: {
      ok: true,
    },
  };
}
```

### Refresh the session with the same data but renew the expiration date.

> src/routes/refresh.ts

```js
/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').RequestHandler} */
export async function put({ locals, request }) {
  locals.session.refresh(/** Optional new expiration time in days */);

  return {
    body: locals.session.data,
  };
}
```

### Refresh the session expiration on every request `Rolling` -> default is false!

> Note this currently only fires if a session is already existing

```js
handleSession({
  rolling: true,
});
```

### Express/Connect Integration

This library can integrate with express, polka or any other connect compatible middleware layer.

```ts
import express from "express";
import { sessionMiddleware } from "svelte-kit-cookie-session";

const app = express();

app.use(
  sessionMiddleware({ secret: "A_VERY_SECRET_SECRET_AT_LEAST_32_CHARS_LONG" })
);

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  const sessionData = req.session.data;
  const views = sessionData.views ?? 0;
  req.session.data = { views: views + 1 };
  return res.json({ views: req.session.data.views });
});

app.listen(4004, () => {
  console.log("Listening on http://localhost:4004");
});
```
